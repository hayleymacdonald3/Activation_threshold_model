# An activation threshold model for response inhibition

An activation threshold model to present a conceptual framework to explain
behavioural and neurophysiological data from response inhibition experiments 
requiring partial movement cancellation.
The model comprises both facilitatory and inhibitory processes that compete
upstream of motor output regions. Summary statistics (means and standard 
deviations) of prediced muscular and neurophsyiological data are fitted to
equivalent experimental measures by minimizing a Pearson Chi-square statistic.

Prerequisites: scipy

To run Go and Partial Stop trials using a single facilitation curve: `python ARI_task first`
To run Partial Stop trials with an additional facilitation curve using manual input
for optimized parameters from single facilitation curve: `python ARI_task second`
